Sales Calculation Guidelines

Layaway Sales
Only include completed layaway transactions in the total sales.

Note: If a product has not been picked up, it should not be included in the sales total.

Account Payments
Do not count account payments as part of the sales total for the current invoice.

Tax Exclusion
The total sales amount should be calculated before tax. Tax amounts should not be included.

Returns
All returns must be deducted from the total sales.
